        <h2>Joe Burrow</h2>

        <p>Drafted with the first pick in the 2020 NFL draft, Joe Burrow rifled onto the scene putting up historic numbers. During his 10th game, Burrow suffered a big hit that resulted in him tearing both his ACL and MCL, and damaging some ligiments in his knee. Even with all of this, he has continued to fight through thick and thin and will bounce back even better next season with the addition of Jamarr Chase, his college teammate.</p>
        <h2>Jessie Bates III</h2>

        <p>Jessie Bates the III was taken in the second round of the 2018 NFL draft and has quickly asserted himself as one of the best safeties in the leage being rated #1 by Pro Football Focus. Bates has come up with 3 interceptions in each of his first three years in the leage and he is only getting better. He has yet to be selected to a ProBowl, but has been selected to an AllPro Second Team. With the new additions to the team, his impact will only grow more with the stakes of the game becoming more important.</p>
